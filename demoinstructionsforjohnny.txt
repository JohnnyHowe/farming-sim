Open a command prompt and change to a directory containing only your project zip file. To minimise the time needed to verify your project, please perform this step before your demo
Run the appropriate command to generate the checksum of your zip file. Note you need to replace <filename> with the name of your project zip file
For Windows: certutil -hashfile <filename> md5
For Mac: md5 <filename>
For Linux: md5sum <filename>
We will check that the checksum matches the one we have calculated from your project submission. If they do not match the demo will not continue
Unzip your archive by running
jar xf <filename> where <filename> is the name of your project zip file
Start your game by running
java -jar <filename> where <filename> is the name of your JAR file
